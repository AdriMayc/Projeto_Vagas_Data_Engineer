<p>Zencoder is building the next generation of AI coding agents — advanced tools that supercharge developer workflows and elevate engineering impact. Our mission is to transform how software is built by equipping developers with AI-powered tools that boost productivity, improve code quality, and unlock creativity.</p>
<p>Our product integrates seamlessly with JetBrains IDEs and VS Code, helping developers generate, refactor, and repair code. It includes fast and intelligent AI code completion, and our agents can independently perform tasks like running shell commands or searching the web to assist with coding and debugging. We're especially proud of our proprietary Repo Grokking™ technology, which enables our AI agents to deeply understand your entire codebase, providing the strongest contextual understanding on the market. Zencoder also connects with 20+ popular tools like Jira, Sentry, GitHub, and GitLab, making it the most integrated AI coding solution available.</p>
<p>This is just a small part of what Zencoder is all about. There’s much more to discover — and we’re just getting started.</p></div><div class=""h2""><strong>🛠️ What You’re Getting Into</strong></div>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Data Analyst</strong> to help us shape how we collect, analyze, and act on data across our AI-powered coding platform. You’ll build scalable data infrastructure, design high-quality data models, help evaluate our agents, and make sure decision-makers have the insights they need — from engineers to product managers to the founder.</p>
<p>You’ll be joining a small but ambitious Data &amp; Analytics team on the ground floor. This is a rare opportunity to set the foundation for analytics at a fast-moving AI company led by serial founder Andrew Filev (ex-Wrike), where your work directly impacts the future of how software is built.</p>
<div class=""h2"">🔍 What You’ll Do</div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Design and run A/B tests that help us move fast without guessing — you'll guide the team in making smart, data-informed choices, and build out best practices for experimentation that everyone can rely on.</li>
<li style="""">Develop and implement standardized processes for tracking new analytical events;</li>
<li style="""">Turn raw data into real insights — dig into product usage, agent performance, and user behavior to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and where to go next.</li>
<li style="""">Level up our analytics game by improving our reporting systems and introducing new metrics that reflect how users experience our AI tools.</li>
<li style="""">Build trust in our data with robust quality checks and validation processes.</li>
<li style="""">Architect DWH data models, create and optimize SQL queries and data models for cross-layer DWH data transformation using DBT.</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2"">🧰 Tech Details</div>
<p>Our current toolkit includes <strong>Amplitude, GCS, BigQuery, DBT, and Python</strong>, but we’re not locked in. You’ll help shape the architecture and pick the right tools as we scale.</p>
<p>We work with <strong>massive, AI-specific data</strong> like prompts and user content — not just pageviews and clicks. There’s very little legacy, so you won’t spend your days untangling old pipelines. Instead, you’ll be laying the groundwork for a data platform that powers the future of AI development.</p>
<div class=""h2"">🧠 What <strong>You Bring</strong></div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Strong statistical or mathematical background.</li>
<li style="""">5+ years of experience in quantitative analysis, with a focus on evaluating product performance.</li>

<li style="""">A passion for data-driven decision making and the ability to answer complex questions through metrics and analytics.</li>
<li style="""">Proficiency in SQL, including writing and optimizing complex queries.</li>
<li style="""">Understanding of Data Governance and Data Quality processes.</li>
<li style="""">Experience creating reports and dashboards using BI tools.</li>
<li style="""">Willingness to take on data engineering tasks when needed.</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2"">🌟 Nice to Have</div>
<ul style="""">

<li style="""">Experience in DWH development projects, understanding key approaches and concepts in building analytical data warehouses.</li>
<li style="""">Experience with Amplitude.</li>
<li style="""">Experience with DBT and BigQuery.</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2"">🚀 Why Zencoder?</div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Massive Impact: AI is changing how software gets made. You’ll be building tools at the center of that shift.</li>
<li style="""">No Busywork: We cut out the noise so you can focus on solving interesting problems.</li>
<li style="""">Experienced Leadership: Andrew Filev scaled Wrike from nothing to a $2B exit — and he’s not here to waste time.</li>
<li style="""">High Talent Density: Senior team. No babysitting.</li>
<li style="""">Remote Friendly: We hire globally and care more about output than timezones.</li>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Through <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://hts.hopper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTS</a>, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are <a class=""postings-link"" href=""http://1.6x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1.6x</a> more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. </p>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Through <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://hts.hopper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTS</a>, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are <a class=""postings-link"" href=""http://1.6x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1.6x</a> more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>

<p>🚀<strong> THE OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Tired of boring pipelines and clunky data tools? So are we.</p>
<p>We're building an AI-powered ELT platform that takes the pain out of data engineering — automating the boring stuff and helping teams move faster, cleaner, and smarter. As a Backend Developer, you’ll be writing real code that solves real problems at scale, using modern tools (Python, TypeScript, AWS) and working with people who love clean architecture and shipping fast.</p>
<p>🧠 <strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p>You’ll join a remote crew of engineers, product thinkers, and designers who:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Care about writing clean, testable code.</li>
<li style="""">Actually enjoy talking about systems, performance, and architecture.</li>
<li style="""">Believe in async-first work, deep focus time, and short meetings.</li>
<li style="""">Want to build something developers would love to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re here to ship product, not PowerPoints.</p>
<p>🛠️ <strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Build and evolve our backend using Python and TypeScript (Node.js).</li>
<li style="""">Design and scale REST APIs for high-performance data operations.</li>
<li style="""">Use AWS tools like Lambda, S3, Redshift, and DynamoDB to power our platform.</li>
<li style="""">Help shape our infrastructure using Terraform and the Serverless Framework.</li>
<li style="""">Collaborate across product, design, and QA to deliver features that just work.</li>
</ul>
<p>🧩<strong> WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">At least 3 years of experience with a backend language (e.g., Python, Java, C); our stack is <strong>Python and TypeScript.</strong></li>
<li style="""">You’ve touched AWS or other cloud platforms, and know your way around REST APIs.</li>
<li style="""">You care about performance, code clarity, and reducing complexity.</li>
<li style="""">You write code you’d be proud to show other devs.</li>
<li style="""">Strong English skills  — we're remote, so clear communication matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 <strong>YOUR FIRST 90 DAYS</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Day 1–30: Set up, explore the stack, fix something small, push code to prod.</li>
<li style="""">Day 31–60: Own a feature, work closely with QA, and demo your code.</li>
<li style="""">Day 61–90: Lead a feature, deploy it, squash bugs, and drop 🔥 PRs like a pro.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY THIS ROLE ROCKS</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Modern stack, no legacy mess.</li>
<li style="""">Full ownership, no micromanagement.</li>
<li style="""">Remote-first culture built for devs.</li>
<li style="""">You’ll ship things that matter — and fast.</li>
